# Cain Homebrew Content Module

## Overview

As a part of the [Cain](https://github.com/diabeatz96/cain) system, I have expanded on creating a module that will provide all homebrew content from one repository and module. This module is an add-on to the system and is by no means required. 

## How to download and use this content.

1. You must download and install Cain foundry vtt system
2. Under modules you will download the raw link from module.json
3. Install mod in Foundry VTT
4. Activate mod in Foundry

## How to add your own content to this homebrew.

First off it is important to note a few things.
1. Homebrew content can consist of Exorcisists, Sins, Mundane NPCS, Adventures (Investigations), Blasphemies, and Agendas Journals (PDFS, TEXT, ADVENTURES, ETC) (As of now) 
2. You will need git, github account, foundry v11 or foundry v12. 
3. **All content must be in put in a sub folder. Any assest you put outside of it will not transfer. Your pictures must be stored in a subfolder on the module**

Currently there are a few ways to get your content on here. 
1. Create an issue and show me where your homebrew content is. 
2. Message adamkostandy on discord for request to be added to this collection.
3. Use github to make a pull request and manually add your resources into this.
